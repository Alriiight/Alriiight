- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alriiight
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code. I decided to make a career change and finally had the courage to start programming. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics on HTML, CSS, Java on The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. Hopefully I will continue onto back-end languages later on.
